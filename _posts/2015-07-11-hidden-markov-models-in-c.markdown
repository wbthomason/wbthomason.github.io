In this post, we'll explore the math behind Hidden Markov Models (or HMMs),
and then work through a practical implementation, which the Magical Wheel of
Languagesâ„¢ says will be in C++.
You can find the final implementation
[here](https://github.com/wbthomason/crouchingtigerhiddenmarkov).
We'll be explaining everything from fundamentals for this, so you shouldn't
need any preexisting knowledge (other than familiarity with C++).
That said, a basic grounding in probability may help you grasp the concepts more
easily.
