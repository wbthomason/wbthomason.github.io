In this thrilling installment of *something bloglike*, we're going to learn
about Hidden Markov Models (to be more succinctly referred to as HMMs). We'll
start with the math behind the model, and then work through a practical
implementation, which the Magical Wheel of Languagesâ„¢ says will be in C++.
You can find the final implementation
[here](https://github.com/wbthomason/crouchingtigerhiddenmarkov).
Everything necessssary will be explained from fundamentals, so you shouldn't
need any preexisting knowledge (other than familiarity with C++) to get the gist
of the tutorial.
That said, a basic grounding in probability may help you grasp the concepts more
easily.
