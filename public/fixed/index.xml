&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/wbthomason/unfamiliar-gestures&#34;&gt;unfamiliar gestures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;My current research project seeks to create and analyze a framework capable of
inferring meaning from unfamiliar human gestures. In interactions between
humans, we frequently assume shared contextual knowledge and common grounding.
This allows us to make gestures without a guarantee that our conversational
partners are familiar with them, but maintain a reasonable level of certainty
that we will be understood. Although this is a desirable ability for human-robot
interactions, current approaches to understanding gestures, natural language, or
the fusion thereof, fall short in this area. I hope to solve this problem.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/wbthomason/rosbeam&#34;&gt;rosbeam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;As part of an effort to enable the Beam Remote Presence Device to be usable as
a platform for robotic development, I updated and improved upon a project to
reverse engineer the Beam&amp;rsquo;s motor control interface and provide a ROS wrapper.
Starting from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/xlz/rosbeam&#34;&gt;prior work&lt;/a&gt;, this entailed a rewriting of the
primary mechanism used to enable execution of foreign code. The internals of the
Beam software had changed significantly since the original project was created,
so the rewriting was a good opportunity to also restructure the code. Doing so
resulted in a much more future-proof implementation of the original approach.
The project was fairly short and easy, and is currently being used in the
experimental verification phase of another research effort into algorithms for
social navigation.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/wbthomason/bork&#34;&gt;bork&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;bork stems from a frustration of mine with most package managers. By
necessity, I use systems running Windows, OS X, and several distros of Linux
(primarily Arch and Ubuntu). This combination forms an uneven surface of package
manager capabilities and interfaces. Further, I have yet to find a package
manager which supports all of my desired use cases natively and easily (though
Arch&amp;rsquo;s pacman comes closest). This, combined with a desire to use &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rust-lang.org/&#34;&gt;Rust&lt;/a&gt;
for a real project, led me to create bork, which I refer to as a &amp;ldquo;package
manager-manager&amp;rdquo; (i.e. a manager of package managers). It allows for a clean,
extensible union of arbitrary package sources (whether other managers,
independent build processes, or otherwise) and provides a fast, uniform
interface with highly expressive composable commands.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/wbthomason/minigrade&#34;&gt;minigrade&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Minigrade is fundamentally a very powerful, extensible autograding server.
Created originally for a class I TAed in undergrad, it sought to provide a
lightweight, secure, and fast server for grading programming assignments by running test
cases and streaming the results back to the user. In the implementation of the
test case/evaluation side of things, a fairly powerful mechanism for describing
partial evaluation states was created and added. I&amp;rsquo;m in the process of rewriting
Minigrade in &lt;a href=&#34;http://elixir-lang.org&#34;&gt;Elixir&lt;/a&gt; for increased performance and
robustness.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/wbthomason/drunk-uncle&#34;&gt;drunk uncle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Drunk Uncle (named for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/cast/bobby-moynihan-15336/character/drunk-uncle-16241&#34;&gt;Bobby Moynihan character&lt;/a&gt;) is an automated
argument system. It started as a project at HackDuke, and was rewritten
afterward for performance and capability. Essentially, given an opinionated
statement on a subject, Drunk Uncle determines the sentiment and subject of the
statement and searches the Internet for evidence against the statement. This
evidence is then presented to the user in an insulting manner. The system is
only a novelty, and I do not recommend its use by anyone for anything, ever.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/wbthomason/ironkernel&#34;&gt;ironkernel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;IronKernel was one of the first kernels written in Rust, back when the
language was in version 0.8 or so. Though it&amp;rsquo;s now little more than a curiosity,
given how fast the language has evolved and the creation of more robust kernels
and operating systems (such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/redox-os/redox&#34;&gt;redox&lt;/a&gt;), it
was a fun project at the time, and achieved a degree of notice in the Rust
community.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/wbthomason/botulism&#34;&gt;botulism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;In undergrad, I worked as a TA for a class offered both to the open Internet
and students at my university. We needed an IRC bot for the course to
communicate with students outside of the university, so, as a simple exercise, I
wrote botulism - a Python library for IRC bots and a sample bot implemented
using the library. I&amp;rsquo;m fairly certain that there are more fully-featured, robust
libraries for this purpose by now, but botulism remains one of the simplest I&amp;rsquo;ve
seen, and served its purpose well.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m Wil Thomason, a first-year PhD student in computer science at Cornell.  My
primary research interests are in robotics, though I&amp;rsquo;m also interested in
programming languages, algorithms, machine learning, and interdisciplinary
efforts among these areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, I&amp;rsquo;m interested in algorithms for efficient cooperation in
heterogenous multi-agent scenarios. I want teams of humans and arbitrary
robotic systems to be able to work together in a manner which both &amp;ldquo;feels&amp;rdquo;
natural (i.e.  equivalent to or better than working with a team of humans
alone) and is efficient and effective (i.e. utilizes differences in
capabilities between the agents well, eliminates redundant work, allows for the
accomplishment of tasks flexibly and quickly, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, I work with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~rak/&#34;&gt;Professor Ross Knepper&lt;/a&gt; on projects related to
gestural understanding and multi-agent planning.&lt;/p&gt;
