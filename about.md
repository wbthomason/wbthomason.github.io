I am a fifth-year PhD candidate in the [Department of Computer Science](http://www.cs.cornell.edu)
at Cornell University. I work on **combining symbolic and geometric planning**. Specifically, I'm
interested in improving the *efficiency*, *robustness*, and *autonomy* of robot task and motion
planning.

Though I primarily research **robotics**, I'm also interested in machine learning, programming
languages, and interdisciplinary efforts among these areas. I am graciously funded by the [NDSEG
Fellowship][ndseg]. I am advised by [Professor Ross Knepper][rak] in the [Robotic Personal
Assistants Lab](https://rpal.cs.cornell.edu/).

# Research

I work on **combining symbolic and geometric planning**, often referred to as "integrated task and
motion planning". My work explores approaches to task and motion planning that provide high
performance and robustness to action failure with lightweight domain-specific assumptions. I also
research approaches to improved planning effort reuse through abstract plan representation and
fusions of classical planning with modern machine learning for more efficient, automatic planning
and execution.

I'm also interested in algorithms for efficient cooperation in heterogeneous multi-robot teams ---
in particular, for ad hoc teams. I want teams of humans and arbitrary robotic systems to be able to
work together in a manner which both "feels" natural and is efficient and effective.

For more about my research, please see my [publication and presentation][pubs] list.
