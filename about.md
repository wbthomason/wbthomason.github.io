# about me

I'm Wil Thomason, a first-year PhD student in computer science at Cornell.
My primary research interests are in robotics, though I'm also interested in
programming languages, algorithms, machine learning, and combinations of
all of these.
In particular, I'm interested in working on algorithms for efficient cooperation
in heterogenous multi-agent scenarios. I want teams of humans and arbitrary robotic
systems to be able to work together in a manner which both "feels" natural
(i.e. equivalent to or better than working with a team of humans alone) and is efficient
and effective (i.e. utilizes differences in capabilities between the agents well,
eliminates redundant work, allows for the accomplishment of tasks flexibly
and quickly, etc.)

# about the blog

A collection of postings on a variety of topics, mostly math and CS-related in
nature.
A fair number of tutorial-esque articles (I like learning about things, and
find that writing about them is one of the best ways to crystallize that
knowledge), as well as some more opinion-based essays, discussions of my
other personal projects, summaries of papers (my own and those of others),
and possibly other material.
Hopefully useful to someone other than myself.
Not a banana.
