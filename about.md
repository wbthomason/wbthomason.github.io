I'm Wil Thomason, a first-year PhD student in computer science at Cornell.  My
primary research interests are in robotics, though I'm also interested
inprogramming languages, algorithms, machine learning, and combinations of all
of these.  In particular, I'm interested in algorithms for efficient cooperation
in heterogenous multi-agent scenarios. I want teams of humans and arbitrary
robotic systems to be able to work together in a manner which both "feels"
natural (i.e. equivalent to or better than working with a team of humans alone)
and is efficient and effective (i.e. utilizes differences in capabilities
between the agents well, eliminates redundant work, allows for the
accomplishment of tasks flexibly and quickly, etc.)
