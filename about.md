I'm Wil Thomason, a first-year PhD student in computer science at Cornell.  My
primary research interests are in robotics, though I'm also interested in
programming languages, algorithms, machine learning, and interdisciplinary
efforts among these areas. In particular, I'm interested in algorithms for
efficient cooperation in heterogenous multi-agent scenarios. I want teams of
humans and arbitrary robotic systems to be able to work together in a manner
which both "feels" natural (i.e.  equivalent to or better than working with a
team of humans alone) and is efficient and effective (i.e. utilizes differences
in capabilities between the agents well, eliminates redundant work, allows for
the accomplishment of tasks flexibly and quickly, etc.)
