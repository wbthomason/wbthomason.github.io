# about the blog

A collection of postings on a variety of topics, mostly math and CS-related in
nature.
A fair number of tutorial-esque articles (I like learning about things, and
find that writing about them is one of the best ways to crystallize that
knowledge), as well as some more opinion-based essays, and discussions of my
other personal projects.
Hopefully useful to someone other than myself.
Not a banana.
