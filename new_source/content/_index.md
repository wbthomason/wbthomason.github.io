I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Kavraki Lab](http://kavrakilab.org/) at Rice University. I work with [Professor Lydia Kavraki](https://www.cs.rice.edu/~kavraki/) on **combining symbolic and geometric planning**. Specifically, I’m interested in improving the _efficiency_, _robustness_, and _utility_ of robot task and motion planning (TMP), with a particular focus on making TMP under uncertainty practically useful.

Though I primarily research **robot planning**, I’m also interested in ML and formal methods for robotics, robotics research broadly, and programming languages. I am graciously funded by the [CRA CIFellows 2021 postdoctoral fellowship](https://cifellows2021.org/2021-class/).

# Research

I work on combining symbolic and geometric planning, often referred to as **“integrated task and motion planning”**. My work explores approaches to task and motion planning that provide high performance and robustness to action failure with lightweight domain-specific assumptions. I also research approaches to improved planning effort reuse through abstract plan representation and fusions of classical planning with modern machine learning for more efficient, automatic planning and execution.

<!--   I’m also interested in algorithms for efficient cooperation in -->
<!--   heterogeneous multi-robot teams — in particular, for ad hoc teams. I -->
<!--   want teams of humans and arbitrary robotic systems to be able to -->
<!--   work together in a manner which both “feels” natural and is -->
<!--   efficient and effective. -->
