I'm Wil Thomason, a second-year PhD student in computer science at Cornell.  My
primary research interests are in robotics, though I'm also interested in
programming languages, algorithms, machine learning, and interdisciplinary
efforts among these areas.

In particular, I'm interested in algorithms for efficient cooperation in
heterogeneous multi-agent scenarios. I want teams of humans and arbitrary
robotic systems to be able to work together in a manner which both "feels"
natural (i.e.  equivalent to or better than working with a team of humans
alone) and is efficient and effective (i.e. utilizes differences in
capabilities between the agents well, eliminates redundant work, allows for the
accomplishment of tasks flexibly and quickly, etc.)

Currently, I work with [Professor Ross Knepper][rak] on projects related to
situated gestural understanding and multi-agent planning.
