I'm Wil Thomason, a second-year PhD student in computer science at Cornell. My
primary research interests are in **robotics**, though I'm also interested in
programming languages, algorithms, machine learning, and interdisciplinary
efforts among these areas.

# Research

I'm interested in algorithms for efficient cooperation in
heterogeneous multi-agent scenarios - in particular, for ad hoc teams. I want teams of humans and 
arbitrary robotic systems to be able to work together in a manner which both "feels"
natural and is efficient and effective.

Currently, I work with [Professor Ross Knepper][rak] on projects related to
situated gestural understanding, contextual language understanding, and multi-agent planning.
