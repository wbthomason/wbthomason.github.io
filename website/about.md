I'm Wil Thomason, a third-year PhD student in computer science at Cornell. My primary research
interests are in **robotics**, though I'm also interested in machine learning, programming
languages, algorithms, and interdisciplinary efforts among these areas.

# Research

I'm interested in **planning**, particularly in **integrated task and motion planning** and
**multi-robot collaboration**.

In task and motion planning, I'm interested in exploring tighter integration between existing
planners to eliminate backtracking and replanning. I'm also interested in combining traditional
planners with machine learning approaches for skill transfer and adaptation.

I'm interested in algorithms for efficient cooperation in heterogeneous multi-robot teams --- in
particular, for ad hoc teams. I want teams of humans and arbitrary robotic systems to be able to
work together in a manner which both "feels" natural and is efficient and effective.

Currently, I work with [Professor Ross Knepper][rak] on projects related to
situated gestural understanding, contextual language understanding, and multi-agent planning.
